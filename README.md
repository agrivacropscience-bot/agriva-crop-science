# Agriva Crop Science

Simple static website for Agriva Crop Science — a small informational site for the company's vision, mission and contact details.

## Features
- Clean, responsive landing page (HTML + CSS).
- Hero section, About, Vision & Mission cards, Contact and Footer.
- Semantic HTML and accessibility improvements (skip link, proper landmarks).
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for Organization.

## Tech
- HTML5
- CSS (single file, easily split into separate stylesheet)

## Run locally
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/muttaki5555-hue/agriva-crop-science.git
2. Open the site:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a local server).
   - Optional: run a local static server (recommended for testing):
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
     - Then open `http://localhost:8000`

## Deployment
- Any static host will work (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
- Add favicons, a `manifest.json` and an HTTPS certificate (host providers usually handle HTTPS).

## Accessibility & SEO checklist
- Ensure logo image has descriptive `alt` text and provide responsive `srcset`.
- Verify color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt when publishing.
- Add meta description and OG/Twitter tags (included in the sample index.html).
